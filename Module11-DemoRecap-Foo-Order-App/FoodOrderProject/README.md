# Fixing Form Input IDs
With the current implementation of MealItemForm, every MealItem <Input /> receives the same id, as I do the following in the code I show in the previous lecture:

<Input
    label='Amount'
    input={{
        id: 'amount',
        type: 'number',
        min: '1',
        max: '5',
        step: '1',
        defaultValue: '1',
    }}
/>
This works but it has two major disadvantages which are not immediately obvious (and hence unfortunately slipped through during the recordings):

Clicking on ANY label will always select the same, first input element - even if that's not the one belonging to the actual MeatItem

Screenreaders won't be able to connect labels + inputs correctly (since all labels point at the same input)

Everything shown in the videos works as shown and fixing this is optional, but since fixing this is easy, you might want to consider making the below adjustments:

One possible workaround is to accept an id prop on the MealItemForm component and use that to create a unique id per <Input />:

<Input
    label='Amount'
    input={{
        id: 'amount_' + props.id, // this changed!
        type: 'number',
        min: '1',
        max: '5',
        step: '1',
        defaultValue: '1',
    }}
/>
We just have to make sure that the id props is passed correctly to <MealItemForm /> when that component is being used (i.e. inside of the MealItem component):

<MealItemForm id={props.id} />
Last but not least, for that to work, we should also pass id as a prop to MealItem, hence inside of the AvailableMeals component, we should create <MealItem /> elements like this:

<MealItem
    id={meal.id} // this is new!
    key={meal.id}
    name={meal.name}
    description={meal.description}
    price={meal.price}
/>
Again, this is all 100% optional when it comes to the general functionality of this demo app - everything works as shown in the videos without these changes as well. But for proper accessibility, you should consider making these adjustments.

I did also update all the code snapshots to reflect these changes.
